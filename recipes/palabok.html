    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pancit Palabok is a Filipino rice noodle dish with a rich pork and shrimp
      sauce, similar to a ragu, and is also often called Pancit Luglug or Pancit
      Malabon (learn the subtle differences!). Garnished with smoked fish, eggs,
      and crumbled chicharron, it’s a classic dish that can be made with this
      simple palabok recipe!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Annato</strong> - native to tropical regions, anatto seeds come
        from the achiote tree and are found in Caribbean, Latin America and
        Filipino cuisines. Mild in flavor, it adds a brilliant yellow-orange hue
        to foods. You can find anatto seeds whole, as a powder or in a paste,
        and may be labeled or spelled as annatto, achuete, atsuete, or achiote.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bihon</strong> - bihon are a thin rice noodles in the
        Philippines and the typical noodle of choice for Palabok. The word
        "bihon" originates from Hokkien term for vermicelli.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chicharron</strong> - also known as pork rind, crumbled
        chicharron is sprinkled on top of the dish to add both umami and crunch.
        I adore the texture of the crumbled chicarron, but when making a
        vegetarian version, you could very easily use seasoned panko
        breadcrumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fish sauce</strong> - known as patis in the Philippines, it is
        used in place of salt and adds not just saltiness but umami to the dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tinapa</strong> - it is a smoked fish often made of milkfish
        (bangus). The flaked fish is also a delicious topping for palabok that
        adds a lovely saltiness to the dish. Look for tinapa flakes at your
        Asian market, or substitute with smoked trout which can easily be found
        amongst the canned fish.

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, begin by getting a pot and filling it with water. Over high heat,
        bring the water to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Drop in the bihon
        noodles and cook as you would cook pasta. Make sure the noodles are al
        dente. Discard the water and drain the noodles. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, make achuete oil by combining 2 tbsp oil and achuete seeds in a
        pan. When it starts to sizzle and the seeds turn dark, remove seeds and
        reserve the oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pan, throw in the garlic and sauté until brown. Add in the
        shrimp and the flour, and stir constantly to cook. Continue to cook
        until thick and you can smell the nutty aroma and the shrimp turns
        bright in color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly pour in the water next with the shrimp heads. Now, bring to a
        boil then add the Knorr Shrimp Cube and Knorr Pork Cube.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the shrimp heads after simmering for 6-8 minutes, then season
        with fish sauce and pepper to make adjustments in flavour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the Bihon noodles in a platter and pour the sauce over. Top with
        your choice of topping and that’s our dish! No need to buy instant
        pancit, for this Pancit Palabok is easy to make. Have it over merienda
        or dinner or any meal time, it will truly satisfy!
